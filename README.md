# Liferay Sample Workspace

![Build status](https://github.com/rafoli/liferay-sample-workspace/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Current stable version: v1.0.0

## Getting Started
1. On your terminal, clone this repository into a local directory of your choice (preferably, use your home directory or subfolder).
2. Inside this directory and the `liferay-sample-workspace` folder, run `blade gw initBundle` to download and install a `bundles` subfolder into your workspace folder, containing all the components needed to start a Liferay local instance on your local machine.

## Starting a Liferay Local Instance
1. Open a new tab in your terminal, and go to `./bundles/tomcat-9.X.X/bin` subfolder.
2. Run `blade server start` or `blade server start -d` debug mode (for Linux users) to start a Liferay DXP local instance.
4. Copy an activation key to the `deploy` folder to register a Liferay license for DXP Development.
5. Open a tab in your browser and type `localhost:8080`.
6. Follow the ***Basic Configuration*** steps, inserting an email and a password, and then accepting the ***Terms of Use***.
7. You should be redirected to the *Home* page of your Liferay DXP instance.

## Deploy Modules
1. Go back to the first tab of your terminal, execute `blade gw deploy` command to download aBadgend install the dependencies needed to deploy the modules.
2. Next, you can check the activated modules via Gogo Shell, typing `blade sh lb sample`.
3. You should see *five* Liferay Sample Modules from this project with `Active` state.

## Adding Liferay Sample Module into Liferay Portal
1. Go back to the *Home* page of your Liferay DXP instance opened in your browser.
2. In the Control Menu, click on the *Edit* button.
3. Search for *Liferay Sample Module JS*.
4. Drag and drop the widget inside the page, and then click on *Publish".
5. You should see a **mock data** set representing a sample response from the module (soon, you shall see it corresponds to a sample response of a sample GET request).

## Importing Collection into Postman
1. Launch Postman and go to your workspace, if it's already created.
2. Click on *Import* button and search for `Liferay.postman_collection.json` within the `postman` folder. 
3. After importing, you should see two collections of *five* requests (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) which correspond to the *five* methods implemented in this project, using ***mock data*** and REST APIs architecture.
4. Also, you should see in *Environments* tab, a *Sample Module Mock Server*, which has a `baseUrl` variable defined.

## Granting Access to the Web Service
1. To use these APIs, you have to grant access to them. 
2. Otherwise, a *Access Denied* message will display as a response to your request. 
3. In order to grant access, go to *Auth* tab of each request and insert into *Username* and *Password* fields the email and password of the user who you've just created in your Liferay DXP instance (Step 5 of **Starting Liferay Local Instance** topic).
4. After that, you should submit a request and then have as a response the ***mock data*** defined within each sample method.

## Making Requests via Postman
* You can make requests for both `Sample Module External API` and `Sample Module Liferay API` collection, just opening the desired request and click on *Send* (Note: your Liferay DXP instance must be running!).
* For instance, the response for the `GET Samples` request (for both collections) would be:

* The **mock data** is defined within the `OK` example file from the `Sample Module External API` collection to represent the response of each request.

## Making Requests via Frontend (Angular)
...


## Importing Collection into Mockoon
1. Download mockoon (https://mockoon.com/) and launch the application.
2. Click on *Import/export -> Mockoons format -> import from a file (JSON)* button and search for `Liferay.mockoon_collection.json` within the `mockoon` folder. 
3. After importing, you should see *4 methods*, it will to make available mocks for the application. You should click in play (green button) to start the server befor make the tests.
4. Now, you can test the endpoints in the Postman, for instance, call endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/samples`

## Configure System Settings
1. In Liferay application, go to the *Control Panel -> System Settings -> category.liferay-confguration*.
2. Search `api-base-url` and change it to `http://localhost:3001` and update.
3. Now, you can do CRUD operations from your application.

## Liferay REST API Architecture Overview
The scheme below illustrates the workflow of a Liferay web service.

### liferay-sample-module-js-web
* The `liferay-sample-module-js-web` module corresponds to the frontend layer of the entire module, i.e., the **view** layer of the MVC portlet architecture. 
* It is responsable to display the data on the page, using Angular technology (a JavaScript framework) and send the users' request to `liferay-sample-module-web-rest` .

### liferay-sample-module-web-rest
* The `liferay-sample-module-web-rest` module corresponds to the application component, i.e., the **controller** layer of the MVC portlet architecture. 
* It is responsable to send the users' request to the `liferay-sample-module-api` module.

### liferay-sample-module-api
* The `liferay-sample-module-api` module contains the model and service definition, in this project the `SampleObject` model and the `SampleService` interface.
* With `liferay-sample-module-service` module, both of these modules corresponds to the **model** layer of the MVC portlet architecture.

### liferay-sample-module-service
* The `liferay-sample-module-service` is responsable for implementing those methods defined within the `SampleService` interface, at `liferay-sample-module-api` module. 
* Also, the `liferay-sample-module-service` module sends the users' request to the `liferay-sample-module-ws-client` module and takes its response, sending back to the previous modules.
* The `liferay-sample-module-service` module includes a `SampleServiceMapper` class, which maps specific entities' properties from the client-side to corresponding attributes defined within the `SampleObject` model.
* Those attributes are the ones displayed within the Angular frontend layer (`liferay-sample-module-js-web`).

### liferay-sample-module-ws-client
* The `liferay-sample-module-ws-client` module is the responsable for sending requests to external APIs and sending a `response` object back to the previous modules.

### liferay-sample-module-tests
* The `liferay-sample-module-tests` module includes all functional tests related to the Page Objects defined, leveraging Selenium framework features.
